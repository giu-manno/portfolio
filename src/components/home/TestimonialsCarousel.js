                        <p>Most importantly, this flexibility does not come from being receptive to anything without criteria, but rather from understanding the points raised, reflecting on them, and identifying where and how to make some concessions. In conclusion, she is proving to be an excellent professional who has quickly become an important part of the entire process."</p>

You navigate through all areas to try to understand whether your thoughts on design align with what is expected by the business and what is feasible to develop.
